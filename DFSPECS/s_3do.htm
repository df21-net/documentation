<strong><font size="+1">General  Description</font></strong>

<p>
They contain the "3D" objects. (samples : MOUSEBOT,
the DEATH STAR HOLOGRAM, ...) </p>

<p><font size="+0">They are text files containing a geometric description
of a full 3D object, and are converted from 3D Studio .ASC format. They
accept # comments. </font></p>

<strong>Note: </strong>"Underscore ("_")  in the 3DO name makes other objects behind it show 
improperly - they get shown as if they are in front of the object rather 
than behind it (that excludes other 3DOs with underscore in their names for some reason).
 Underscore somehow changes sorting order, Z-buffering or  some other rendering parameter
 probably giving a benefit in speed. Since the speed isn't really a problem for DF anymore, it's 
recommended not to use underscore in the names of 3DO files."

and QUADS for quadrilaterals. The polygons are described with a number
starting at 0, then the vertex number for each end point is given (3 for
triangles and 4 for quadrilaterals). Then a color is given to each polygon
(0 to 255). Finally comes the shading used for each polygon. </font></p>

</b>These link texture vertices into a 3 or 4 sided polygon, hence deciding

                                ....the bottom half of the texture will be placed onto QUAD 0 of the object (i.e. up to an X value of 16, but only up to a Y value of 4) with the first vertice of the TEXTURE QUAD being placed on the first vertice of the QUAD, the second vertice on the second, and so on. So you can also orientate the portion of texture on the polygon any way you want by keeping the TEXTURE VERTICES pointed to in the same order, but varying the starting vertice, flip it by reversing the order of TEXTURE VERTICES pointed to, or even deform the texture by varying the order of the TEXTURE VERTICES pointed to.

  <p>
In this example, the texture will be flipped horizontally, and be on its side relative to TEXTURE QUAD 0 (the first example).

  <p>
  
Of course, this section of the texture will need to be scaled to cover the whole polygon, so if the polygon is, say, a 64 by 32 rectangular QUAD, the texture will be expanded by a factor of 4 for the above example. If the polygon doesn't have dimensions of the same ratio as the portion of texture, the texture portion will be warped, eg. if the polygon for the above example is shaped like a regular trapezium, the top part of the texture will be squashed and the bottom part stretched.
  <p>
It is okay to point to the same texture vertices over and over again if you for example want to put the same section of a texture on more than one polygon in the object.
  
<p>
<strong>Note: </strong>TEXTURE VERTICES and TEXTURE QUADS / TRIANGLES are also needed for PLANE fill, although you can't decide what part of a texture is to be placed on a PLANE polygon. Hence the TEXTURE VERTICES pointed to by the TEXTURE QUAD / TRIANGLE are unused.
<p>
  
TEXTURE QUADS / TRIANGLES correspond with the polygons (having TEXTURE, GOURTEX or PLANE fill) that they are linked to. So if QUAD 0 and 2 of an object have a texture fill, but QUAD 1 is just gouraud or flat or otherwise, then TEXTURE QUAD 0 and 2 will be used, but TEXTURE QUAD 1 must also be defined even though it isn't used. So to be economical, you should have all polygons filled with a texture defined first within each object of the 3DO file.
