<h3>General Description </h3>

<p>
    GOL files control the functioning of the objective screen in the PDA. They contain a list 
    of mission goals which are shown to be completed in the objective screen when they are 
    fired. 
</p>
<p>
    The objective screen is an <a href="./s_anim.htm">ANIM</a> in <a href="s_dfbrf.htm">DFBRIEF.LFD</a>. 
    It is composed of a number of DELTs (with yellow text) which are overlaid on the first embedded DELT (which has green text) as goals are completed.
</p>

<table border="1" width="600"><tr><td><pre>
/* TALAY.GOL */

GOL 1.0
  GOAL: 0 	TRIG:   0
  GOAL: 1       ITEM:   5	# DT weapon
  GOAL: 2       TRIG:   1       # Return to your ship for immediate evacuation.</pre>
</td></tr></table>
<p>

<table>
    <tr>
        <td><img src="images/gol000.png" /></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><img src="images/gol001.png" /></td>
        <td><img src="images/gol002.png" /></td>
        <td><img src="images/gol003.png" /></td>
    </tr>
</table>


<p>
    Each GOAL: can be<br /> 
    a TRIG: -- a goal trigger<br/> 
    an ITEM: -- a goal item.
</p>

<h3>Goal triggers</h3>
<p>
    These are goals that are fired by the .INF file when a "<a href="./s_inf.htm#msg_cmplt">complete</a>" message is sent. 
</p>
<p>
    The parameter (a number) sent with the message fires the corresponding goal in the GOL file.
</p>
<p>
For instance,  <pre>message: [stop] [recipient] complete 3</pre> will fire the goal "TRIG: 3".
</p>

<h3>Goal Items </h3>
<p>
These are goals which are fired when you pick up a goal item. The logics of the goal items fire an internal message to the GOL when the item is picked up.

<p>
Each goal item has a num of its own, which is hardcoded:
<p>
<table border="1" cellpadding="5">
<tr><th>Goal item</th><th>Description</th><th>Num</th></tr>
<tr><td>LOGIC: PLANS</td><td>Death Star plans</td><td>0</td></tr>
<tr><td>LOGIC: PHRIK</td><td>Phrik metal</td><td>1</td></tr>
<tr><td>LOGIC: NAVA</td><td>Nava Card</td><td>2</td></tr>
<tr><td>LOGIC: DATATAPE</td><td>data tapes</td><td>4</td></tr>
<tr><td>LOGIC: DT_WEAPON</td><td>broken DT weapon</td><td>5</td></tr>
<tr><td>LOGIC: PILE</td><td>Your Gear</td><td>6</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
For instance, picking up a DT_WEAPON will fire the "ITEM: 5" goal.
Notice this implies that you can only use one of each goal item in each level.
<p>

<strong>Note: </strong>
    <br />The goal items will also move an elevator named "complete" to its next stop when picked up.
<p>

<h3>Managing Goals</h3>

<p>
    The best way to handle goals is to use an inaccessible (dummy) elevator named "complete" only for mission goal/completion management. 
    It should have a number of "hold" stops and a final "complete" stop. Each goal you accomplish will move elevator
    "complete" one stop forward, until accomplishing the final goal moves it onto its "complete" stop, completing 
    the level. 
</p>

<table border="1" width="600">
    <tr>
        <td>
            <pre>
/* INF file */

item: sector name: complete
 seq
   class: elevator move_floor
     stop: 0 hold           
     stop: 1 hold           /* first goal done */
     stop: 2 hold           /* second goal done */
     ......
     stop: 10 complete      /* final goal done, mission complete */
 seqend
</pre>
        </td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p>
    The following INF message will move the <strong>complete</strong> elevator to its next stop,
    in addition to firing the GOL file.

    <pre>message: [stopnum] complete complete [goalnum]</pre>
    
     Goal items automatically move the <strong>complete</strong> elevator when they are picked up, as mentioned above.
</p>
<p>
Don't get confused with the 3 different "complete" keywords ! One is a message, one is the name of an elevator, and one is a stop option just like "hold".
</p>
<p>

<p>
    <strong>Final note: </strong>Goals do <em>not</em> need to happen in the order listed in the GOL file! You
    may create a level where the player can complete the goals in any order.
