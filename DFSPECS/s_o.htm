<p>

<hr size="2">

<a name="ff_obt"></a>
<font size="+1"><strong>Object Tables </strong></font><p>

As there is a lot of OB information in a level, 4 object tables are created to avoid storing OB names in full at each occurrence.
<p>

<table border="1" width="600"><tr><td><pre>
| PODS 3             # These are the "3D" objects
|  POD: DEATH.3DO    # 00
|  ...
|
| SPRS 10            # These are the SPRITES
|  SPR: OFFCFIN.WAX  # 00
|   ...
|
| FMES 6             # These are the FRAMES
|  FME: IENERGY.FME  # 00
|  ...
|
| SOUNDS 1           # These are the SOUNDS
|  SOUND: BANG.VOC   #00
|  ...
<pre></td></tr></table>   <!-- PRE missing slash is voluntary -->
<p>

Afterwards, all the objects are referred to by their 0 based index in the object tables. <br>
The object CLASS determines in which table to look.
<p>

<hr size="2">

<a name="ff_obd"></a>
<font size="+1"><strong>Object Descriptions </strong></font><p>

<ul>
<li><a href="#ff_obd_sl"> Sequences and Logics </a>
<li><a href="#ff_obd_gn"> Generators </a>
</ul>

The first data is the total number of objects in the level :
<p>

<table border="1" width="600"><tr><td><pre>
| OBJECTS 185
<pre></td></tr></table>   <!-- PRE missing slash is voluntary -->
<p>

Then each object is described.<br>
Please note that the object data first line has been split here for visual convenience.
<p>

<table border="1" width="600"><tr><td><pre>
| CLASS: SPIRIT  DATA:  0 X: 131.00 Y:    0.00    Z: 210.00
\                       PCH:   0.00 YAW: 176.34 ROL:   0.00
\                       DIFF: 1
|  SEQ
|   LOGIC:     PLAYER
|   EYE:       TRUE
|  SEQEND
|
| CLASS: SPRITE  DATA:  0 X: 320.62  Y:  20.00   Z:  275.64
\                       PCH: 0.00  YAW: 270.00 ROL:    0.00

|  SEQ
|   TYPE:      I_OFFICER
|  SEQEND
<pre></td></tr></table>   <!-- PRE missing slash is voluntary -->
<p>

CLASS is the type of object, and DATA is the offset in the corresponding object table.
(SPIRIT and SAFE have DATA = 0).
<p>

X, Y, Z are the position of the object in the level. 
	This is the same coordinate system as found in the LEV file. 
	The Y coordinate is "flipped" as in the LEV file (positive is down, negative is up).
<p>

PCH, YAW, ROL are classic spatial orientation. Values are in degrees.
	For YAW, 0 is north and the value increases clockwise (90 degrees is east).
	PCH (pitch) and ROL (roll) are only relevant for 3DOs. They have no effect on sprites and other objects.
<p>

DIFF is the difficulty level at which the object appears.
<p>

<table border="2">
 <tr><td><strong>DIFF </strong></td><td><strong>EASY </strong></td><td><strong>MED </strong></td><td><strong>HARD </strong></td></tr>
 <tr><td>-3 </td><td>X </td><td>X </td><td>X </td></tr>
 <tr><td>-2 </td><td>X </td><td>X </td><td>  </td></tr>

<font size="+1"><strong>Sequences and Logics </strong></font><p>

SEQ and SEQEND are delimiters for a series of properties/modifiers to apply to the object 
 which determine its behavior.
<p>
The basic thing that most entities will have is a LOGIC: that controls it. 
<p>
Logics are hardcoded in DARK.EXE. For enemies, they determine its AI, eg. what weapon it uses, its health
and intelligence, what sounds it makes.
<p> In addition, logics are important for controlling how frames are displayed from a WAX file.
<p></p>


<a href="#ol"> See Full Logics List</a>
<p>


<strong> LOGIC alternatives and interchanging </strong><br />
The same sprite may be used with different logics provided they are compatible.
<p> 
	For instance, OFFCFIN.WAX may be used with a 
	LOGIC: I_OFFICER or LOGIC: I_OFFICERB which will generate a blue key when killed instead of the usual 
	ammo clip. 
<p>
Or you can use OFFCFIN.WAX with LOGIC: STORM1 and although the enemy will appear like an officer, it will 
	behave as a stormtrooper.

<p>

The keywords TYPE: and LOGIC: are freely exchangeable, and the ITEM keyword is optional before item logics.
<p>

<strong>Combined Logics</strong>
<p>

If you combine enemy logics, the first LOGIC: is in this case the primary logic, which means that to kill the object, <br>you have to use the firepower needed to kill its first LOGIC: .<p>Very strange things may happen when combining LOGICs, and some combinations don't work, or even don't work every time!
Try Mousebot + Barrel, or Player + Mousebot...<br/>

<p>
	LOGIC: ANIM is designed to be safely combined with many items and scenery objects.
</p>


<hr size="2">

<a name="ff_obd_gn"></a>
<font size="+1"><strong>Generators </strong></font><p>

Generators cause enemies to appear mid-way through a level. Here is a quite self explaining example:<p>

<table border="1" width="600"><tr><td><pre>
| CLASS: SPRITE  DATA:  4 X: 396.88   Y:  -2.00   Z: 217.48
\                       PCH:   0.00 YAW:   0.00 ROL:   0.00 
\                      DIFF: 1
|  SEQ
|   LOGIC:     GENERATOR STORM1
|   DELAY:     30
|   INTERVAL:  20
|   MIN_DIST:  70
|   MAX_DIST:  200
|   MAX_ALIVE: 3
|   NUM_TERMINATE: 8
|   WANDER_TIME: 40
|  SEQEND
<pre></td></tr></table>   <!-- PRE missing slash is voluntary -->
<p>

All generated enemies will use the sprite defined, and will appear "awake" (i.e. walking around, not standing still)
 from the X, Y and Z coordinates of the generator.<p>


<strong>LOGIC:</strong>  is the logic that the generated sprites will have. <p>Note the GENERATOR keyword. <p>
<strong>Note</strong> also that only the following logics are allowed to be generated (generating others will cause problems
 and usually crash the game!)<p>
<pre>
	I_OFFICER and key variations
	TROOP
	STORM1
	COMMANDO
	BOSSK
	G_GUARD
	REE_YEES
	REE_YEES2
	SEWER1
	INT_DROID
	PROBE_DROID
	REMOTE
</pre><p>
DELAY: is the time in seconds that needs to pass from the start of a level before the generator starts operating.<p>

INTERVAL: is the time in seconds between each generation.<p>

For an enemy to be generated, the player must be at a distance from the generator that is between <br>MIN_DIST and MAX_DIST.<p>

MAX_ALIVE: is the maximum number of enemies from the generator allowed alive at the same time.<p>

NUM_TERMINATE: is the number of enemies to be generated. When this is reached, the generator deactivates.<br> If set to -1, an infinite amount will be generated, and the generator will never deactivate.<p>

WANDER_TIME: is the time in seconds that a generated sprite walks around before becoming inactive.<p>

<strong>Note: </strong>in DARK.EXE, there is a keyword "PLUGIN:" among the above generator keywords. Its usage is still unknown.<p>

Sprites aren't generated when the generator is able to see you, however (otherwise it would look like the 
enemies were walking out of thin air!). The best way to observe a generator working is therefore on the map
 by using the LACDS cheat.<p>

Also note that you can set MASTER: OFF on a generator (not to be confused with the INF master variable!), 
and activate it by sending a "master_on" message to the sector that contains it.
<p>

<a name="ol"></a><font size="+1"><strong>All Objects Logics </strong></font><p>

This is a list of all the objects and other modifiers that can be used in the sequences of objects.
<p>
Please also see the end of this section for some unknowns found in DARK.EXE.
<p>


<strong>Player</strong><p>

<pre>
| LOGIC:     PLAYER
| EYE:       TRUE
</pre><p>
These should always be used together. Technically though, the LOGIC: PLAYER is the entity that you will control  and move around, while EYE: TRUE is the object from whose point of view the level is viewed from. <br>So yes, you can try following enemies and mousebots around with the eye......<p>



<strong>Items</strong><p>
Remember that you can use ITEM keyword before these logics.<br>
Message is the message number from TEXT.MSG that is displayed when you pick up the item <br>(just in case you want to patch).<p>

<strong>3D Object Motion Logics</strong>
<p>
<pre>
There are 2 logics for giving motions to a  3D object:
LOGIC: UPDATE to perpetually rotate a 3D, and 
LOGIC: KEY to give a VUE motion to the 3D
<p>
</pre>
<table border="1" cellpadding="5">
<tr><td>Rotation on X-axis</td><td>Rotation on Y-axis </td><td>Rotation on Z-axis </td></tr>
<tr><td><pre>

LOGIC:   UPDATE 
FLAGS:    8
D_PITCH:  [speed]
</pre></td><td><pre>

LOGIC:    UPDATE 
FLAGS:    16
D_YAW:    [speed]
</pre></td><td><pre>
LOGIC:   UPDATE 
FLAGS:   32
D_ROLL:  [speed] 
</td></tr></pre>
</table>
<p>

Speed is the speed at which the 3D object rotates from -999 (max anti-clockwise) to 999 (max clockwise).

<p>

<strong>VUE Object</strong><p>
<table border="1" cellpadding="5"><tr><td><pre>
LOGIC:          KEY
VUE:            filename.VUE "id"
VUE_APPEND:     filenam2.VUE "id"
PAUSE:          TRUE
FRAME_RATE:    [frame rate]
</pre></td></tr>
</table>
<p>

filename.VUE is the name of the VUE file to use.<p>

"id" is the name of the identifier within the VUE file to use<p>

VUE_APPEND: is an optional VUE to be played after the first VUE.<p>

PAUSE: TRUE will cause the VUE to pause each time it is played until a "wakeup" message is sent to the sector  containing the 3D object. Objects with "PAUSE: TRUE" will also be "woken up" if their RADIUS is shot.<p>

Frame rate is in frames per second.
<p>
<br>

<strong>Other Sequence Modifiers</strong><p>

 BOSS:	TRUE<br>
This can be set to the following logics:
<br><pre>
	BOBA_FETT
	KELL
	D_TROOP1
	D_TROOP2
	D_TROOP3
</pre><p>
When you kill the enemy, an elevator called "boss" will move to its next stop <br>(unless it is LOGIC: D_TROOP3, where the elevator must be called "mohc"). This is similar to the movement of "complete" when a goal item is picked up. Using this modifier, you can cause something to happen when the player has killed the boss, for instance the player could be locked in a certain area until he has killed the boss and then a door will be opened letting him out.
<p>        
<br>

 <table border="0">
<tr><td width="80"><strong>RADIUS:</strong></td><td>[horizontal distance]
</td></tr>
</table><br>
	This defines the radius of the object's cylindrical "hit box". Frames and sprites have collision detection
	by default, but 3D objects don't, so you have to set one if you want the object to seem "solid". 
	You can use this with a Spirit to create an invisible obstacle.
<p>
	<br>

	<table border="0">
		<tr><td width="100"><strong>HEIGHT:</strong></td><td>[vertical distance]</td></tr>
	</table>
	<br>
	Similar to radius, height defines the vertical size of the object's "hit box". A positive value is up and a 
	negative value is down, relative to the object's origin. Using radius and height together, an object will have 
	a cylinder-shaped hit box for the purpose of collision detection.
<p>
<br>
	RADIUS and HEIGHT can be used with items and enemies to increase their default "hit box" size.
<p>
